Monthly Per Capita Expenditure Prediction Project: User Guide
This guide explains how to use our monthly per capita expenditure prediction project. It is divided into two sections: one for users interested in replicating the model and another for users who wish to obtain a prediction.

For Researchers and Developers
1. Dataset Access
Action Required:
Download the datasets provided with the project.
Instructions:
The datasets are available in common formats (such as CSV or JSON). You can either import them directly into your programming environment or save them locally for further analysis.
2. Install Dependencies
Action Required:
Ensure that all required Python libraries are installed on your system.
Instructions:
A list of dependencies is provided in the project documentation. You may use a command like pip install -r requirements.txt to install all libraries simultaneously.
3. Running the Code
Action Required:
Follow the provided code examples to run the prediction model.
Instructions:
The code is well-documented with step-by-step instructions. Review the comments in the code to understand each part of the process and how to replicate the model successfully.


For End Users
